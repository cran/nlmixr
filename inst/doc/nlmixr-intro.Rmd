### Introduction
'nlmixr' is an R package for fitting general dynamic models,
pharmacokinetic (PK) models and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD)
models in particular, with either individual data or population
data. `nlmixr` has five main modules: 

1. `dynmodel()` and its mcmc cousin `dynmodel.mcmc()` for nonlinear
    dynamic models of individual data;
2. `nlme_lin_cmpt()`for one to three linear compartment models of
   population data with first order absorption, or i.v. bolus, or
   i.v. infusion;
3. `nlme_ode()` for general dynamic models defined by ordinary
   differential equations (ODEs) of population data; 
4. `saem.fit()` for general dynamic models defined by closed-form
   solutions or ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of population
   data by the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization
   (SAEM) algorithm; 5) `gnlmm()` for generalized non-linear
   mixed-models (optionally defined by ordinary differential
   equations) of population data by adaptive Gaussian quadrature
   algorithm.

A few utilities to facilitate population model building are also
included in `nlmixr`.

```{r}
library(nlmixr, quietly = TRUE)
```

### Non-population dynamic model 

The `dynmodel()` module fits general dynamic models, often expressed
as a set of ODEs, of individual data with possible multiple endpoints.
This module has similar functionality as the `ID` module of `ADAPT 5`.

We use two examples from the ADAPT 5 User's Guide to illustrate the
usage of non-population dynamic model with `dynmodel()`.

#### Inverse Gaussian Absorption Model

> This example illustrates the use of the inverse Gaussian (IG)
> function to model the oral absorption process of a delayed release
> compound. It is assumed that the plasma drug concentration following
> oral administration of the drug can be decomposed into an
> independent input process (representing dissolution, transit and
> absorption processes) followed by the disposition process. It is
> further assumed that the parameters of a linear two compartment
> model used to describe the disposition process have been estimated
> following intravenous drug administration to an individual. The
> model shown in Figure 1 will then be used to describe the plasma
> kinetics of an oral formulation of the drug delivered to the
> individual.

**Figure 1. Two compartment disposition model with IG function input**


This system of a two-compartment disposition model with IG absorption is defined in the following string:
```{r}
ode <- "
   dose=200;
   pi = 3.1415926535897931;

   if (t<=0) {
      fI = 0;
   } else {
      fI = F*dose*sqrt(MIT/(2.0*pi*CVI2*t^3))*exp(-(t-MIT)^2/(2.0*CVI2*MIT*t));
   }

   C2 = centr/V2;
   C3 = peri/V3;
   d/dt(centr) = fI - CL*C2 - Q*C2 + Q*C3;
   d/dt(peri)  =              Q*C2 - Q*C3;
"
sys1 <- RxODE(model = ode)

```

> In the model above the systemic drug input function, $f_i(t)$, is
assumed to be a single inverse Gaussian function defined as: $$ f_i(t)
= D\cdot F\sqrt{\frac{MIT}{2\pi CV_t^2 t^3}}
\exp\left[-\frac{(t-MIT)^2}{2CV_t^2 MIT t}\right]$$ where `MIT`
represents the mean input time and $CV^2$ is a normalized variance (
is the standard deviation of the density function $f_i(t)/(D\cdot F)$
divided by `MIT`, i.e., the relative dispersion of input times). The
factor `F` is the bioavailability of the orally administered dose .

In this example, disposition parameters are assumed known.  The three
parameters related to the delayed absorption, `MIT`, `CVI2` and `F`,
are to be estimated.

`dynmodel()` takes the following arguments: an RxODE object (compiled
ODE solver), a list of formulae that relates system defined quantities
and measurement(s) with either or both additive error `add()` and
proportional error `prop()`, an event table object that defines the
inputs and observation schedule, a named vector with initial values of
system parameters, a `data.frame` contains the data, optional known
system parameters (`fixPars`) not to be estimated, and other optional
control parameters for optimization routines.

```{r}
dat <- invgaussian;
mod <- cp ~ C2 + prop(.1)
inits <- c(MIT=190, CVI2=.65, F=.92)
fixPars <- c(CL=.0793, V2=.64, Q=.292, V3=9.63)
ev <- eventTable()
ev$add.sampling(c(0, dat$time))
(fit <- dynmodel(sys1, mod, ev, inits, dat, fixPars))
```

More information about the model (convergence information and number
of function evulation of the optimization process) is displayed by
calling the `summary()` function.  Basic goodness-of-fit plots are
generated by calling `plot()`.

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
summary(fit)
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1), mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(fit, cex=2)

```



#### Parent/Metabolite (multiple endpoints)

> Figure 2 shows the model used to describe the kinetics of a parent
> compound and its metabolite used in this example. The model relating
> dose of the parent compound to the plasma concentrations of parent
> drug and its metabolite can be rewritten in terms of the ratio
> $Vm/fm$ along with the other model parameters $Kp, Vp, K_{12},
> K_{21}$ and $fm$.


![Figure 2. pmeta](pmetab.png)

**Figure 2. Model for example pmetab. Kp is the total elimination rate
of the parent compound, while fm represent the fraction metabolized.**

Note the list that specifies the statistical measurement models for
concentrations of both parent and its metabolite.

```{r}
ode <- "
Cp = centr/Vp;
Cm = meta/Vm;
d/dt(centr) = -k12*centr + k21*peri -kp*centr;
d/dt(peri)  =  k12*centr - k21*peri;
d/dt(meta)  =                        kp*centr - km*meta;
"
sys2 <- RxODE(model = ode)

dat <- metabolite
mod <- list(y1 ~ Cp+prop(.1), y2 ~ Cm+prop(.15))
inits <- c(kp=0.4, Vp=10., k12=0.2, k21=0.1, km=0.2, Vm=30.)
ev <- eventTable()
ev$add.dosing(100, rate=100)
ev$add.sampling(c(0, dat$time))
(fit <- dynmodel(sys2, mod, ev, inits, dat))
```

Alternative error models can be tested and compared without
re-compilation of the system.  For instance, a combined error
structure with both additive and proportional errors for the parent
compound concentration is easily re-fitted with the following code:
```{r}
mod <- list(y1 ~ Cp+add(.2)+prop(.1), y2 ~ Cm+prop(.15))
(fit <- dynmodel(sys2, mod, ev, inits, dat))
```

Although the combined error produces a slightly higher likelihood, the
previous proportional error model has smaller AIC and BIC, and is
hence preferred.


#### Parent/Metabolite (continued - mcmc estimation)

The `dynmodel.mcmc()` has a similar functionality and user interface
as `dynmodel()` for general dynamic models, except it uses Bayesian
Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (mcmc) for estimation.  The underlying
sampling algorithm is Neal's efficient slice sampling algorithm.

```{r}
mod <- list(y1 ~ Cp+prop(.1), y2 ~ Cm+prop(.15))
(fit <- dynmodel.mcmc(sys2, mod, ev, inits, dat))
```

`dynmodel.mcmc()` returns a matrix of raw mcmc samples.  This matrix
can be further manipulated for further plots and inferences.  For
instances, trace plots can be easily generated by the following:

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(4,2), mar=c(2,4,1,1))
s <- lapply(1:dim(fit)[2], function(k) 
     plot(fit[,k], type="l", col="red", ylab=dimnames(fit)[[2]][k]))
```

### Linear compartment models 
`nlme_lin_cmpt()` fits a linear compartment model with either first
order absorption, or i.v. bolus, or i.v. infusion using the estimation
algorithm implemented in the 'nlme' package.  A user specifies the
number of compartments (up to three), route of drug administrations,
and the model parameterization. `nlmixr` supports the clearance/volume
parameterization and the micro constant parameterization, with the
former as the default.  Specification of fixed effects, random effects
and intial values follows the nlme notations.

We use an extended version of the Theophiline PK data [^1] accompanied
with the NONMEM distribution (also an example in the nlme
documentation) as an illustration of `nlme_lin_cmpt`.  We model the
Theophiline PK by a one-compartment model with first order absorption
and with default clearance/volume parameterization.  All model
parameters are log-transformed; random effects are added to `KA` and
`CL`.

[^1]: To demonstrate/test the capability of handling multiple doses by
    `nlme_lin_cmpt`, we simulated the Day 7 concentrations with a once
    daily (*q.d.*) regimen for 7 days, in addition to the Day 1
    concentrations of the original Theophiline data.

```{r}
dat <- theo_md;
specs <- list(fixed=lKA+lCL+lV~1, random = pdDiag(lKA+lCL~1), start=c(lKA=0.5, lCL=-3.2, lV=-1))
fit <- nlme_lin_cmpt(dat, par_model=specs, ncmt=1)
summary(fit)
plot(augPred(fit,level=0:1))
```

I.V. bolus can be specified by setting `oral=FALSE`, i.v. infusion by
`oral=FALSE` and `infusion=TRUE`.  To use micro-constant
parameterization, one simply sets `parameterization=2`.  Covariate
analyses can be performed with the nlme() notations.  In the following
sample code, `WT` is a covariate to the log-transformed `CL` and `V`.

```{r}
specs <- list(
	fixed=list(lKA~1, lCL+lV~WT), 
	random = pdDiag(lKA+lCL~1), 
	start=c(0.5, -3.2, 0, -1, 0))
fit <- nlme_lin_cmpt(dat, par_model=specs, ncmt=1)
#plot(augPred(fit,level=0:1))
#fit
```

Additional arguments/options to nlme() can be passed along via calls
to `nlme_lin_cmpt`.  For instance, if information on the iteration
processs of optimization is of interest, one may pass `verbose=TRUE`
to nlme() when calling `nlme_lin_cmpt`.  

```
fit <- nlme_lin_cmpt(dat, par_model=specs, ncmt=1, verbose=TRUE)
``` 

Typically, nlme-defined models do not require starting values for
inter-individual variance components. If you do want to specify these,
the initial 'random' statement would need to be replaced with: 

```
random = pdDiag(value=diag(c(2,2)), form =lKA+lCL~1) 
``` 

where the 'value' statement specifies the starting values for the
diagonal random-effects matrix in this case. The values are the square
of the CV of the IIV divided by the residual error SD: with an IIV of
30% and a residual error of 20%, starting values would be
(0.3/0.2)^2=2.25.

### Parameterization in `nlme_lin_cmpt`
Depending on the model selection and parameterization selection, for
internal calculations, `nlme_lin_cmpt` uses a particular set of
parameterizations from the following list, the first three being the
clearance/volume parameterizations for one-three compartments, and the
last three the corresponding micro constant parameterizations.  `TLAG`
is excluded when `tlag=FALSE`, `KA` and `TLAG` are excluded when
`oral=FALSE`.

```
pm <- list(
    c("CL", "V", "KA", "TLAG"),
    c("CL", "V", "CLD", "VT", "KA", "TLAG"),
    c("CL", "V", "CLD", "VT", "CLD2", "VT2", "KA", "TLAG"),
    c("KE", "V", "KA", "TLAG"),
    c("KE", "V", "K12", "K21", "KA", "TLAG"),
    c("KE", "V", "K12", "K21", "K13", "K31", "KA", "TLAG")
)
dim(pm)<-c(3,2)
```    

Model parameters in the `par_model` argument and the parameters used
for internal calculations are bridged by a function supplied to the
`par_trans` argument.  A user can do any parameter transformation
deemed necessary within such a function, however, symbols defined in
the environment of the `par_trans` function (including the formal
arguments and the derived variables) have to be a superset of
parameters required by a particular model with the chosen route of
administration, parameterization and `tlag` flag.  For instance, with
`ncmt=1`, `oral=TRUE`, and `parameterization=1`, the environment of
the `par_trans` function has to contain `CL`, `V` and `KA`; whereas
with `ncmt=1`, `oral=TRUE`, `parameterization=2`, and `tlag=TRUE`, the
environment of the `par_trans` function has to have `KE`, `V`, `KA`,
and `TLAG`.

To facilitate models with the clearance/volume parameterization and
the micro parameterization, `nlmixr` provides a set of predefined
`par_trans` functions with log-transformed parameters of linear
compartment models with different routes of administration and
parameterizations.  Arguments `ncmt`, `oral`, `parameterization`, and
`tlag` to function `nlme_lin_cmpt` uniquely determine a proper
`par_trans` function via an internal utility.  Below is such a
function for `ncmt=1`, `oral=TRUE`, `parameterization=1`, and
`tlag=TRUE`.

```
par.1cmt.CL.oral.tlag <- function(lCL, lV, lKA, lTLAG)
{
  CL <- exp(lCL)
  V <- exp(lV)
  KA <- exp(lKA)
  TLAG <- exp(lTLAG)
}
```

With this model, a user needs to specify the fixed-effects,
random-effects and initial values of the fixed effects for parameters
`lCL`, `lV`, `lKA`, and `lTLAG`.

If a user perfers to parameterize a linear compartment model other
than the supported parameterizations, he/she needs to write a
cutomized parameterization function and supply the `par_trans`
argument when calling `nlme_lin_cmpt`.  Note that in the following
example, the customized `par_trans` function defines `KE`, `V`, and
`KA` -- parameters needed for `ncmt=1`, `parameterization=2` with the
default options `oral=TRUE` and `tlag=FALSE`.

```{r}
mypar <- function(lKA, lKE, lCL)
{
    KA <- exp(lKA) 
    KE <- exp(lKE) 
    CL <- exp(lCL)
    V  <- CL/KE
}
specs <- list(
	fixed=lKA+lCL+lKE~1, 
	random = pdDiag(lKA+lCL~1), 
	start=c(0.5, -2.5, -3.2)
)
fit <- nlme_lin_cmpt(
	dat, par_model=specs, 
	ncmt=1, parameterization=2, par_trans=mypar)
#plot(augPred(fit,level=0:1))
fit
```



### Models defined by ordinary differential equations

`nlme_ode()` fits a general population PKPD model defined by a set of
ODEs.  The user-defined dynamic system is defined in a string and
provided to the `model` argument.  The syntax of this mini-modeling
language is detailed in the appendix. In addition to the `par_model`
and `par_trans` arguments as before, a user specifies the response
variable. A response variable can be any of the state variables or the
derived variables in the system definition.  Occasionally, the
response variable may need to be scaled to match the observations.  In
the following example, we model the afore-mentioned Theophiline PK
example by a set of ODEs.  In this system, the two state variables
`depot` and `centr` denote the drug amount in the absorption site and
the central circulation, respetively.  Observations are the measured
drug concentrations in the central circulation (not the drug amount)
at times.  Hence, the response variable is the volume-scaled drug
amount in the central circulation.

```{r}
ode <- "
d/dt(depot) =-KA*depot;
d/dt(centr) = KA*depot - KE*centr;
"
dat <- theo_md;
dat$WG <- dat$WT>70
mypar <- function(lKA, lKE, lCL)
{
    KA <- exp(lKA) 
    KE <- exp(lKE) 
    CL <- exp(lCL)
    V  <- CL/KE
}
specs <- list(fixed=lKA+lKE+lCL~1, random = pdDiag(lKA+lCL~1), start=c(lKA=0.5, lKE=-2.5, lCL=-3.2))
fit <- nlme_ode(dat, model=ode, par_model=specs, par_trans=mypar, response="centr", response.scaler="V")
nlme_gof(fit)
fit
```


### Population modeling utilities
#### Visual Predictive Checks (VPC)

VPC plots can be produced by calling `vpc()`:
```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
vpc(fit, 100)
```

Conditional VPCs can be easily generated:
```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
vpc(fit, 100, condition="WG")
```

#### Bootstrap

```{r}
dat <- theo_md;
specs <- list(fixed=lKA+lCL+lV~1, random = pdDiag(lKA+lCL~1), start=c(lKA=0.5, lCL=-3.2, lV=-1))
set.seed(99); nboot = 20;

cat("generating", nboot, "bootstrap samples...\n")
cmat <- matrix(NA, nboot, 3)
for (i in 1:nboot)
{
	#print(i)
	bd <- bootdata(dat)
	fit <- nlme_lin_cmpt(bd, par_model=specs, ncmt=1)
	cmat[i,] = fit$coefficients$fixed
}
dimnames(cmat)[[2]] <- names(fit$coefficients$fixed)
print(head(cmat))

require(lattice)
df <- do.call("make.groups", split(cmat, col(cmat)))
df$grp <- dimnames(cmat)[[2]][df$which]
print(bwplot(grp~exp(data), df))
```

#### Covariate selection

```{r}
dat <- theo_md;
dat$LOGWT <- log(dat$WT)
dat$TG <- (dat$ID < 6) + 0    #dummy covariate

specs <- list(
	fixed=list(lKA=lKA~1, lCL=lCL~1, lV=lV~1), 
	random = pdDiag(lKA+lCL~1), 
	start=c(0.5, -3.2, -1))
fit0 <- nlme_lin_cmpt(dat, par_model=specs, ncmt=1)
cv <- list(lCL=c("WT", "TG", "LOGWT"), lV=c("WT", "TG", "LOGWT"))
fit <- frwd_selection(fit0, cv, dat)
print(summary(fit))
```



### Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization (SAEM)

`saem_fit()` fits a nonlinear mixed-effect model by the SAEM
algorithm. `saem_fit()` is a compiled function that changes when the
structure model changes.  Before running this function, a user needs
to generate a configuration list by calling the function
`configsaem()`.  Standard inputs to this function are: 

1. a compiled saem model 
2. a data.frame; 
3. a list of covariates (`covar`) and residual model with additive
   (`res.mod=1`), proportional (`res.mod=2`) and combination of
   additive and proportional (`res.mod=3`); 4) initial values for the
   fixed effect and residual error.

```{r}
#ode <- "d/dt(depot) =-KA*depot; 
#        d/dt(centr) = KA*depot - KE*centr;"
#m1 = RxODE(ode, modName="m1")
#ode <- "C2 = centr/V; 
#        d/dt(depot) =-KA*depot; 
#        d/dt(centr) = KA*depot - KE*centr;"
#m2 = RxODE(ode, modName="m2")

PKpars = function()
{
  CL = exp(lCL)
  V = exp(lV)
  KA = exp(lKA)
  KE = CL / V
  xxx = 0;
  #initCondition = c(0,xxx)
}
PRED = function() centr / V
PRED2 = function() C2

#--- saem cfg
nmdat = theo_sd
inits = list(theta=c(.05, .5, 2))
fit = saem.fit(lincmt(ncmt=1, oral=T), nmdat, inits)
fit
## df = plot(fit) ## Canceled by memoise.
``` 


### Generalized non-linear mixed-models (gnlmm)

Generalized non-linear mixed-models (gnlmm) find many useful
applications in different fields, pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics in particular.

`gnlmm()` calculates the marginal likehood by adaptive Gaussian
quadrature.  For a description of this method, please find an
excellent discussion in the documentation of SAS `PROC NLMIXED`.

At minimum, `gnlmm()` takes three arguments: the user-defined
log-likehood function, the data frame and initial values. Initial
values take the form of a named list: `THTA` for fixed effects, `OMGA`
for random effect.  The latter is a list of formulae; the lhs of a
formula specifies the block of correlated random effects (ETAs), the
rhs of the formula gives the initial values of the lower half of the
variance matrix.

#### Count data

This example uses the pump failure data of Gaver and O'Muircheartaigh
(1987). The number of failures and the time of operation are recorded
for 10 pumps. Each of the pumps is classified into one of two groups
corresponding to either continuous or intermittent operation.

```{r}
llik <- function()
{
	if (group==1) lp = THETA[1]+THETA[2]*logtstd+ETA[1]
	else          lp = THETA[3]+THETA[4]*logtstd+ETA[1]
	lam = exp(lp)
	dpois(y, lam, log=TRUE)
}
inits = list(THTA=c(1,1,1,1), OMGA=list(ETA[1]~1))

fit = gnlmm(llik, pump, inits, 
	control=list(
	    reltol.outer=1e-4,
		optim.outer="nmsimplex",
		nAQD=5
	)
)
```

Covariance matrix of fixed-effect parameters can be calculated with
`calcCov()` after a fit.

```{r}
cv = calcCov(fit)
cbind(fit$par[fit$nsplt==1], sqrt(diag(cv)))
```

`gnlmm()` fit matches well of `PROC NLMIXED`.

#### Binary data

For this example, consider the data from Weil (1970), also studied by
Williams (1975), Ochi and Prentice (1984), and McCulloch (1994). In
this experiment 16 pregnant rats receive a control diet and 16 receive
a chemically treated diet, and the litter size for each rat is
recorded after 4 and 21 days.

```{r}
llik <- function()
{
	lp = THETA[1]*x1+THETA[2]*x2+(x1+x2*THETA[3])*ETA[1]
	p = pnorm(lp)
	dbinom(x, m, p, log=TRUE)
}
inits = list(THTA=c(1,1,1), OMGA=list(ETA[1]~1))

gnlmm(llik, rats, inits, control=list(nAQD=7))
```

The `gnlmm()` fit closely matches the fit of `PROC NLMIXED`.

#### `gnlmm` with ODEs

```{r}
ode <- "
d/dt(depot) =-KA*depot;
d/dt(centr) = KA*depot - KE*centr;
"
sys1 = RxODE(ode)

pars <- function()
{
	CL = exp(THETA[1] + ETA[1])#; if (CL>100) CL=100
	KA = exp(THETA[2] + ETA[2])#; if (KA>20) KA=20
	KE = exp(THETA[3])
	V  = CL/KE
	sig2 = exp(THETA[4])
}
llik <- function() {
	pred = centr/V
	dnorm(DV, pred, sd=sqrt(sig2), log=TRUE)
}
inits = list(THTA=c(-3.22, 0.47, -2.45, 0))
inits$OMGA=list(ETA[1]~.027, ETA[2]~.37)
#inits$OMGA=list(ETA[1]+ETA[2]~c(.027, .01, .37))
theo <- theo_md;

fit = gnlmm(llik, theo, inits, pars, sys1, 
	control=list(trace=TRUE, nAQD=5))

cv = calcCov(fit)
cbind(fit$par[fit$nsplt==1], sqrt(diag(cv)))
```

After convergence, `prediction()` can be used to calculate the
prediction.

```{r}
pred = function() {
	pred = centr/V
}

s = prediction(fit, pred)
plot(s$p, s$dv); abline(0,1,col="red")
```

### Appendix: Technical notes


#### RxODE Syntax
An `RxODE` model specification consists of one or more 
statements terminated by semi-colons, `;`, and
optional comments (comments are delimited by `#` and an 
end-of-line marker).  `NB:` Comments are not allowed 
inside statements.

A block of statements is a set of statements delimited by
curly braces, `{ ... }`.
Statements can be either assignments or conditional `if`
statements. Assignment statements can be either `simple`
assignments, where the left hand is an identifier (i.e., variable), or 
special `time-derivative` assignments, where the left hand
specifies the change of that variable with respect to time, e.g., `d/dt(depot)`.

Expressions in assignment and `if` statements can be 
numeric or logical (no character expressions are currently supported).
Numeric expressions can include the following numeric operators 
(`+`, `-`, `*`,
`/`, `^`),   and
those mathematical functions defined in the C or the
R math libraries (e.g., `fabs`, `exp`, `log`, `sin`).
(Note that the modulo operator `%` is currently
not supported.)

Identifiers in an `RxODE` model specification can refer to:

- state variables in the dynamic system (e.g., compartments in a
pharmacokinetics/pharamcodynamics model);
- implied input variable, `t` (time), 
`podo` (oral dose, for absorption models), and
`tlast` (last time point);
- model parameters, (`ka` rate of absorption, `CL` 
clearance, etc.);
- others, as created by assignments as part of the model
specification.

Identifiers consists of case-sensitive alphanumeric characters, 
plus the underscore `_` character.  `NB:` the
dot `.` character is `not` a valid character
identifier.

The values of these variables at pre-specified time points are
saved as part of the fitted/integrated/solved model (see
`eventTable`, in particular its member function 
`add.sampling` that defines a set of time points at which
to capture a snapshot of the syste via the values of these variables).

The ODE specification mini-language is parsed with the help of
the open source tool `DParser`, Plevyak (2015).


#### Dosing events 

A unique feature of general PKPD modeling is the ubiquity of dosing
events.  When a PKPD model is defined by ODEs, the ODE solver needs to
recognize these discrete events and re-start the integration process
if necessary.  Sheiner and Beal implemented the concept of using an
integer variable `EVID` to inform the ODE solver of the nature of the
current event.  In addition to `EVID`, NONMEM includes several other
auxiliary variables to completely and uniquely define a general dosing
event: CMT, AMT, RATE, ADDL, II.

RxODE borrows the core ideas from the NONMEM implementation but uses a
more compact yet somewhat convoluted format to represent the discrete
dosing events.

- `EVID=0` denotes an observation event
- `EVID>0` denotes an dosing event.  In general, an `EVID` in nlmixr has five digits: 
    a. The right-most two digits are reserved for defining different events; 
    b. The next two digits point to which state variable (or compartment) this event is applied to; 
    c. The fifth digit from the right takes a value 1 if the dosing is an infusion and 0 if the dosing is a bolus.
- `AMT` is the drug amount with a bolus dosing.  In case of an infusion, a positive number denotes the start of an infusion at a particular time with such an infusion rate; a negative number denotes the end of a previously started infusion. 


#### `nlmixr` & NONMEM comparison

NONMEM functionality not supported by `nlmixr`:

- mixture model
- steady-state (SS) dosing

`nlmixr` functionality not supported by NONMEM:

- General nested random effects
- ARMA residual model
- anova() for model selection
- integrated GoF & VPC functionality
- integrated simulation with uncertainty


#### Calculating covariance matrix of fixed-effect parameter estimates

```{r}
llik <- function()
{
	if (group==1) lp = THETA[1]+THETA[2]*logtstd+ETA[1]
	else          lp = THETA[3]+THETA[4]*logtstd+ETA[1]
	lam = exp(lp)
	dpois(y, lam, log=TRUE)
}
inits = list(THTA=c(1,1,1,1), OMGA=list(ETA[1]~1))

fit = gnlmm(llik, pump, inits, 
	control=list(
	    reltol.outer=1e-4,
		optim.outer="nmsimplex",
		nAQD=5
	)
)
```

```{r}
cv = calcCov(fit)
Rinv = attr(cv,"RinvS")$Rinv
S    = attr(cv,"RinvS")$S
Rinv*2					#inverse hessian matrix
solve(S)*4			    #inverse of score function product sum	
Rinv %*% S %*% Rinv		#sandwich estimate
```
